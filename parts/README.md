# CND router printable parts

Hi,

All models are made with FreeCad. I'm not a expert user of any CAD program
so maybe parts can be done better. Please send me any improvements or
ideas.

## 3D Printing options

My prototype has been printing with PLA and using default options in Slic3r.
It works perfect and final structure is very solid and stable but feel free
to send your optimizations.

Thank you!
