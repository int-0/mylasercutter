# CNC router construction manual

![](https://github.com/int-0/mylasercutter/raw/master/cnc_view.png)

Hi,

The following step-by-step manual is just for mounting the CNC router used
in my laser project. But this CNC router can be used to mount a common drilling
machine, but some modifications could be needed in the firmware.

NOTE: this manual does not include rods lenghts because sizes can be
      modified by user requeriments.

To compile this manual into one PDF file you can use this Makefile. Maybe you
need some extra packages:

```
# apt-get install librsvg2-bin pdftk
```

And then, just run make:

```
$ make
```

Enjoy!
